//With a while loop, you can execute code repeatably as long as a certain condition is fulfilled.

// JavaScript also has a do-while loop.
do {
    // The code here will always be executed once and then
    // repeatedly while the condition is true.
} while (condition);

//    break keyword to stop the execution of the loop entirely and  used in combination with true as the condition
//   break keyword cannot be used inside a function that is nested in the loop

// continue only stops the execution of the current iteration and continues with the next one. 
// Spotting infinite loops might seem trivial in this toy example, but is not always that easy with more complex code. 

// A for loop can iterate “in reverse” by initializing the loop variable to the starting value, testing for when the variable hits the ending value.
//  decrementing(subtracting from) the loop variable at each iteration.

// A do...while statement creates a loop that executes a block of code once,
//  checks if a condition is true, and then repeats the loop as long as the condition is true

// A for loop declares looping instructions, with three important pieces of information separated by semicolons ;:
// initialization,stopping condition, iteration statement

//  the .length of the array can be used as the stopping condition in the loop.

// Within a loop, the break keyword may be used to exit the loop immediately, continuing execution after the loop body.

// A nested for loop is when a for loop runs inside another for loop.

// A loop is a programming tool that is used to repeat a set of instructions.

// The while loop creates a loop that is executed as long as a specified condition evaluates to true
